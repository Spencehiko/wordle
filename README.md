**Live Demo:  [wordle](http://wordle.hicaku.com/)**

Hi! I was so tired of having only one game per day and I didn't want to wait ^^ So I developed this site. I used **Vue.js + Vuex + TypeScript**. In this app you can play the game 'Wordle' forever* in both English and Turkish!

**: forever means 11972 English and 6552 Turkish words*

If you want to try it out you can simply click **Code > Copy Icon** and go to your Terminal/Cmd etc.

    git clone THIS_REPOSITORY_LINK

After cloning is finished, you **must** install the npm in order to run.

    npm install
    
Then, you are ready to give it a shot! Just type

    npm run serve
and you will see the project in your browser!
